Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money
in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on food, I thought I would <REPLACE_THIS_VERB> about
a little and see the <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> part of the Statue of Liberty. It is a way I have of driving off the
board and regulating circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the depression;
whenever it is a <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE>, <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> November in my house; whenever I find myself involuntarily
<REPLACE_THIS_VERB> before coffin nails, and bringing up the rear of every person I meet; and
especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE>
moral principle to prevent me from deliberately <REPLACE_THIS_VERB> into the ocean, and methodically
<REPLACE_THIS_VERB> people's dogs off—then, I account it high time to get to the park as soon as I can.
There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all anger in their degree,
some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the love with me.
